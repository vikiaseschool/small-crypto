            <h2>Welcome to interactive blockchain learning!</h2>
            <p>On this web you can learn the basics of blockchain and how it works.</p>
            <p><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></p>
            <p>Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that securely stores data across many computers. It works like a chain of blocks, each containing data, such as transaction details. Every time a new block is created, it’s linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This process makes it nearly impossible to alter past data, providing security and trust. Unlike traditional systems that rely on central authorities (like banks), blockchain operates in a decentralized way, meaning no single entity controls it. It’s used for various applications, like cryptocurrency, ensuring transparency, security, and reliability without needing a middleman.</p>
