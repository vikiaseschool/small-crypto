# Blockchain Learning Platform

This project is a simple blockchain learning platform built with Python. It is based on working blockchain. It allows users to generate wallets, create transactions, mine blocks and view the blockchain through an interactive web interface. You can learn how the blockchain works, see every part of the ecosystem and try it yourself.

## Features

- **Generate Wallet**: Create a new wallet with a public and private key.
- **View Wallets**: Display all generated wallets.
- **Create Transaction**: Create a new transaction from one wallet to another.
- **Mine Block**: Add pending transactions to a new block and add it to the blockchain.
- **View Blockchain**: Display the entire blockchain with all blocks and transactions.

## Use of AI
I used AI for improving my informative texts and better implementation of some parts in my code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- ecdsa

## Usage

1. **Generate Wallet**: Click the "Generate Wallet" button to create a new wallet. The wallet details will be displayed in the text area.
